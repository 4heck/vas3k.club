## Installing and running locally

All you need is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:vas3k/vas3k.club.git
cd vas3k.club
```

And run

```
docker-compose up
```

It will start the development server with all the necessary services. Auto-reload on any code change is active.

At the very beginning, you probably need a dev account. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/godmode/dev_login/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/godmode/dev_login/) in your browser, it will log in an redirect you to your new user.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. For small fixes just open a PR, for big changes it makes sense to create an issue first, and explain what and why do you want to change. 

Here's our public [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/SAbS5JiI/) with all TODO's and In Progress.

If you want to report a bug, propose an idea or feature â€” [open an issue](https://github.com/vas3k/vas3k.club/issues) with a specific label.
